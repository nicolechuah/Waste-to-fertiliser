                    <p style="color:rgb(32, 136, 32);">Our food waste collection program aims to reduce food waste by partnering with local businesses, restaurants, and individuals to collect excess, unsold, or expired food. This initiative helps divert food waste from landfills and repurposes it into sustainable products, such as organic fertilizers for gardening. By joining this effort, participants contribute to a circular economy, promoting environmental sustainability while supporting our mission to create eco-friendly solutions from food waste.</p>

                    <h3 style="color:rgb(35, 113, 35);">Types of Food Waste Collected</h3>
                    <p style="color:rgb(35, 113, 35);">We accept a range of food waste including organic waste like fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, and eggshells, as well as leftovers from meals, prepared food, and catering waste. Additionally, we collect packaging waste such as containers when available. This diverse range of waste types is then repurposed into sustainable products, such as fertilizers, contributing to environmental sustainability.</p>

                    <h3 style="color:rgb(35, 113, 35);">Collection Method</h3>
                    <p style="color:rgb(35, 113, 35);">Our food waste collection program offers scheduled pick-up services for participating businesses, restaurants, and individuals. Alternatively, participants can drop off their food waste at designated locations during specified hours of operation.</p>
